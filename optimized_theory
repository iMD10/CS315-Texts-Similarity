The Optimized Jaccard Similarity algorithm calculates the similarity between two texts by comparing their unique words. It uses dictionaries to efficiently count word occurrences and determine the number of unique words, leading to faster comparisons than the naive method.

How the Algorithm Works

	1.	Input: Two strings, text1 and text2.
	2.	Preprocessing: Convert both texts to lowercase and split into words.
	3.	Word Count: Create dictionaries (word_count1 and word_count2) to count the frequency of each word in the texts.
	4.	Intersection and Union Count:
	•	Initialize intersection_count to zero.
	•	Set the union count as the sum of the sizes of both dictionaries.
	•	Loop through word_count1 to check if words exist in word_count2, updating counts accordingly.
	5.	Calculate Similarity:
	•	Return 0.0 if the union count is zero; otherwise, return the ratio of intersection_count to union_count.

Time Complexity

	•	Preprocessing: O(n + m) (for both texts).
	•	Word Count: O(n + m) (filling the dictionaries).
	•	Intersection Count: O(s1) (where s1 is the number of unique words).

Total Time Complexity:
 O(n + m + s1) 

Space Complexity

	•	Dictionaries: O(s1 + s2) (for unique words).
	•	Input Storage: O(n + m).

Total Space Complexity:
 O(n + m + s1 + s2) 

Conclusion

The Optimized Jaccard Similarity algorithm efficiently measures text similarity by utilizing dictionaries for word counting, significantly improving performance over the naive approach, especially for larger datasets. Understanding this algorithm is essential for applications in text analysis and natural language processing.
