The Jaccard Similarity algorithm measures how similar two texts are by comparing their unique words. It calculates a similarity score based on the common words. This documentation covers both the Naive and Optimized versions of the algorithm, focusing on their differences in time complexity.

Naive Jaccard Similarity Algorithm

How It Works

	1.	Input: Two strings, text1 and text2.
	2.	Preprocessing: Convert to lowercase and split into words.
	3.	Set Creation: Create sets (set1 and set2) to eliminate duplicates.
	4.	Intersection Count: Use nested loops to count common words.
	5.	Union Count: Calculate the total number of unique words.
	6.	Calculate Similarity: Return the ratio of intersection to union count.

Time Complexity

	1.	Preprocessing: O(n + m) (for lowercase conversion and splitting).
	2.	Set Creation: O(n + m).
	3.	Intersection Count:
	â€¢	Using nested loops gives O(s1 * s2), where s1 and s2 are the sizes of the sets.
	4.	Union Count: O(s1).

Total Time Complexity:
 O(n + m + s1 \cdot s2)
