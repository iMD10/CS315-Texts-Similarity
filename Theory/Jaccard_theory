# Choosing Jaccard Similarity for Text Comparison

In our analysis, we chose **Jaccard Similarity** as the metric for measuring the similarity between two texts. This choice is based on its ability to effectively quantify the overlap between the unique words of the texts, providing a clear indication of their similarity.

## How to Find Similarity Using Jaccard

To find the similarity between two texts using Jaccard Similarity, follow these steps:

1. **Preprocessing**: Convert both texts to lowercase to ensure uniformity and split them into sets of words. This step removes duplicates and prepares the data for comparison.
   
2. **Set Formation**: Create two sets, `A` and `B`, where:
   - `A` represents the unique words in `text1`.
   - `B` represents the unique words in `text2`.

3. **Calculate Intersection and Union**:
   - Determine the intersection of the sets `A` and `B`, denoted as `A ∩ B`, which represents the common words.
   - Determine the union of the sets `A` and `B`, denoted as `A ∪ B`, which represents all unique words in both texts.

4. **Apply the Jaccard Formula**: The Jaccard Similarity coefficient `J(A, B)` is calculated using the formula:

   `
   J(A, B) = {|A ∩ B|}/{|A ∪ B|}
   `

   where:
   - `|A ∩ B|` is the number of common words (intersection).
   - `|A ∪ B|` is the total number of unique words (union).

## Conclusion

By using Jaccard Similarity, we can efficiently measure the similarity between two texts based on their unique word sets. This method provides a quantitative assessment of how closely related the texts are, making it a valuable tool for various applications in text analysis and natural language processing.
